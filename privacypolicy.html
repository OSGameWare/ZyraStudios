            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p>Effective Date: June 20, 2025</p>

            <p>At Zyra Studios (“we,” “our,” or “us”), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect through our website, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data. Please read this policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

            <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
            <p>We do not collect personal data, such as names, addresses, or email addresses, directly from visitors to our website. However, certain anonymized data (e.g., IP addresses, browser types, and device information) may be collected automatically through Google Search Console. This tool, provided by Google LLC, helps us monitor our website's performance in Google Search results (e.g., clicks, impressions, click-through rates, and average position).</p>

            <p>Google Search Console collects anonymized data that is processed by Google in accordance with its own <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>. We recommend that users review <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a> to understand how data is processed by Google.</p>

            <p>We do not use cookies or other tracking technologies on our website at this time. If we introduce cookies or tracking technologies in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly and provide users with a cookie consent banner allowing them to opt-in or opt-out of non-essential cookies.</p>

            <p>When you submit a contact form on our website, we may ask for your name and email address, but <strong>these fields are completely optional</strong>. If you choose to provide them, we will use this information solely for communication purposes and to respond to your inquiry. If you choose not to provide any personal information, you can still submit the form, but we may not be able to respond as directly to your request.</p>

            <p>The data you provide (if any) will be stored in Google Sheets and processed by Google, in accordance with their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not use the information submitted via the contact form for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us, and we respect your decision to provide or withhold any personal information. The information collected will only be kept for as long as necessary to address your inquiry.</p>

            <h2>2. Use of Collected Data</h2>
            <p>The data we collect through Google Search Console is used solely for monitoring and optimizing the performance of our website in search engine results. This data helps us improve our site’s visibility, functionality, and performance. We do not use this data for advertising, profiling, or marketing purposes.</p>

            <p>We do not use any third-party analytics tools that collect personally identifiable data, such as Google Analytics, on our website.</p>

            <p>We do not share any collected data with third parties for marketing or other purposes. The data collected is for internal use only, and we do not sell or trade any user data.</p>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do not directly share any user data with third parties. However, Google Search Console, which we use for monitoring website performance, may collect and process data in accordance with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>. For more information on how Google handles data, please refer to their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

            <h2>4. User Data Management</h2>
            <p>Since we do not collect personal information directly from users, there are no specific data management options available on our website for you to review or modify your data with us. However, users may manage or review any personal data processed by Google through Google’s privacy settings. For more information on managing your data, please visit <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Account Privacy Settings</a>.</p>

            <p>If you would like to request the deletion of any data that Google may have collected about you, please contact Google directly. We are happy to assist with any inquiries regarding data deletion.</p>
